# Name: capture_training_images.py
# Desc: This program is used to capture training images that will be used by
#   the face recognition program.  The program displays a window with the live
#   video feed.  Any faces that are detected are showed surrounded by a green
#   box.  When the user presses the "k" key, the current face is saved as a
#   unique image in a folder under the "training" folder.
